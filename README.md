# Cupid's Jam

As part of a game jam, renamed Cupid's Jam, organized by the Game Devs at Mac student organization at Macalester College, we created a game from scratch on a Valentine's Day/romance theme. 

Our game, _A Squirrel's Tail_, has been developed in Python programming language using the Pygame library to create a platform game where one squirrel is at the bottom of the screen and jumps on the wooden platforms to climb as high as possible toward its lover at the top without falling. The game includes obstacles and moving platforms that are also randomly generated for each round to keep the game interesting.

We had 48H to complete the game, therefore, here are some modifications we would've added if we had more time:
- Have the play window the same size as the Main Menu window to make it an almost full-screen game
- Improve the accuracy of the collision between squirrel and platform
- Use the up or space keys to jump rather than having the squirrel consistently jump up and down
- Add more sound effects for when the squirrel jumps or when the user loses
- Add levels of difficulties (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 etc), and at the end of each level the squirrel reaches its lover (instead of an endless high-score game)
- Collect hearts equivalent to points on the hard-to-reach platforms
- Add a cursor, a pause, quit, restart, and menu button to the Game window
- Design the Game Over screen to something related to the theme
